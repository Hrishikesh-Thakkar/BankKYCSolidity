Steps to Test the Contract on REMIX:

1. Open Remix (https://remix.ethereum.org/) 
2. Here there will be a directory for contracts. 
3. Under this directory create a new Solidity Smart Contract
4. Copy the KYC.sol file and paste it here.
5. Compile the Smart Contract and then click deploy adter selecting the Environment and test account
6. Once it is successfully deployed click on the arrow next to the deployed contract to see all the functions which are accessible externally.
7. Based on the datatype appropriate details need to be entered and the response are logged in the logs.

For Example in Add Bank:
name : "0x42616e6b31000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
addr : "0xAb8483F64d9C6d1EcF9b849Ae677dD3315835cb2"
registration: "0x42616e6b31000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"

Is a sample request

As Bytes32 is suggested please be mindful to enter all the digits equaling the above sample in name. It is fixed in size and the newer Solidity versions require this. 
Ensure the sol compiler is ^0.8.0;
