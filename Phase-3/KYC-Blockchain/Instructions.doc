Steps On how to Create the Ethereum Test Network:

1. First geth needs to be installed on the target machine
2. Then a directory should be created for this and the init.json should be kept here.
3. Once that is done the geth command is used to create the data directory (geth --datadir ./datadir init ./init.json)
4. In init.json we have to settings for the genesis block which include all the properties such chainId, gasLimit, nonce etc.
5. Now to instantiate the network to accept the incoming requests to it we need to enable rpc (http) requests to do so the below command needs to be executed.
 (geth --datadir ./datadir --networkid 2019 --rpc --rpcport 30303 --allow-insecure-unlock console)
Here the network id and port need to be set. 
6. Now we need to create an account on the Network, this can be done by using personal.newAccount("password")
7. Then this account needs to be unlocked, personal.unlockAccount(eth.accounts[0],"password",0)
8. Then we have to start mining on this node. miner.start() will start the mining process.
9.With this the network is ready to have contract deployed.


Steps On How to Deploy the Smart Contract to the Test Network:

1. First in a new directory truffle init should be called. 
2. Then the contract needs to be pasted in the contacts truffle directory.
3. Then in the migration directory a new file is created 2_kyc_migration.js in which we add the contract to the project.
4. Now we have to open the truffle config and add a configuration for geth node. This is inside the networks tab. 
geth: {
		host: "127.0.0.1",     // Localhost (default: none)
		port: 30303,            // Standard Ethereum port (default: none)
		network_id: "2019",       // Any network (default: none)
     }
5. Then execute truffle compile and truffle migrate --network geth which will deploy the code to the Geth Test Network.
6. Once the migration is successful enter truffle console --network geth
7. Inside this console we have to invoke the contract in the form of a variable
let kyc = await KYCContract.deployed()
8. Now we can execute commands like this: Example Request such as the one below.
 kyc.addBank("0x42616e6b31000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000","0xAb8483F64d9C6d1EcF9b849Ae677dD3315835cb2","0x42616e6b31000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000")
9. This is a sample response which can be returned. With this the contract has been successfully deployed and accessed.

In this project all the configurations are set once the network is ready then truffle migrate is enough to test the project and truffle console commands to test.
